* copy in/create config/environments/*_secret.rb (where * is development, test, production - sets config.rpx_api_key and config.rpx_realm, can get these by creating an {RPX}[http://www.rpxnow.com/] account), e.g.:
    Sosol::Application.configure do
      config.rpx_api_key = '0cdf56769f20a2b73a929ac3ba633152'
      config.rpx_realm = 'sosol-development'
    end
* bundle install

== Design Overview

The Son of Suda On Line (SoSOL) is one of the main components of the
Integrating Digital Papyrology project (IDP), aiming to provide a repurposable
web-based editor for the digital resources in the DDbDP and HGV. SoSOL
integrates a number of technologies to provide a truly next-generation online
editing environment. Using JRuby with the Rails web framework, it is able to
take advantage of Rails’s wide support in the web development community, as
well as Java’s excellent XML libraries and support. This includes the use of
XSugar to define an alternate, lightweight syntax for EpiDoc XML markup, called
Leiden+. Because XSugar uses a single grammar to define both syntaxes in a
reversible and bidirectional manner, this is ideal for reducing side effects of
transforming text in our version-controlled system. SoSOL uses the Git
distributed version control system as its versioning backend, allowing it to
use the powerful branching and merging strategies it provides, and enabling
fully-auditable version control. SoSOL also provides for editorial control of
changes to the main data repository, enabling the democracy of allowing anyone
to change anything they choose while preserving the academic integrity of
canonical published data.

=== Next-Generation Version Control

Many online editing environments, such as MediaWiki, use an SQL database as the
sole mechanism for storing revisions. This can lead to a number of problems,
such as scaling (most SQL servers are not performance optimized for large text
fields) and distribution of data (see for example the database downloads of the
English Wikipedia, which have been notoriously problematic for obtaining the
full revision history). Most importantly, they typically impose a centralized,
linear, single-branch version history. Because Git is a distributed version
control system, it does not impose any centralized workflow. As a result,
branching and merging have been given high priority in its development,
allowing for much more concurrent editing activity while minimizing the
difficulty of merging changes. SoSOL’s use of Git is to have one “canonical”
Git repository for public, approved data and to which commits are restricted.
Users and boards each get their own Git repositories which act as forks of the
canonical repository. This allows them to freely make changes to their
repository while preserving the version history as needed when these changes
are merged back into the canonical repository. These repositories can also be
easily mirrored, downloaded, and worked with offline and outside of SoSOL due
to the distributed nature of Git. This enables a true democracy of data,
wherein institutions still retain control and approval of the data which they
put their names on, but any individual may easily obtain the full dataset and
revision history to edit, contribute to, and republish under the terms of
license.

=== Alternative Syntax for XML Editing

While XML encoding has many advantages, users inexperienced with its use may
find its syntax difficult or verbose. It is still desirable to harness the
expertise of these users in other areas and ease their ability to add content
to the system, while retaining the semantically explicit nature of XML markup.
To do this, we have used XSugar to allow the definition of a “tagless” syntax
for EpiDoc XML, which resembles that of the traditional printed Leiden
conventions for epigraphic and papyrological texts where possible. Structures
which are semantically ambiguous or undefined in Leiden but available in EpiDoc
(e.g. markup of numbers and their corresponding value) have been given
additional text markup, referred to comprehensively as Leiden+. XSugar enables
the definition of this syntax in a single, bidirectional grammar file which
defines all components of both Leiden+ and EpiDoc XML as correspondences, which
can be statically checked for reversibility and validity. This provides much
more rigorous guarantees of these properties than alternatives such as using
separate XSLT stylesheets for each direction of the transform, as well as
encoding the relation between the components of each syntax in a single
location.

=== Repurposable Design

Due to institutional requirements, the DDbDP and HGV datasets needed separate
editorial control and publishing mechanisms. In addition, their control over
different types of content necessitated different editing mechanisms for each
component. These requirements informed the design of how SoSOL interacts with
data under its control and how this design is repurposable for use in other
projects. The two high-level abstractions of data made by SoSOL are
“publications” and “identifiers”. Identifiers are unique strings which can be
mapped to a specific file path in the repository, while publications are
arbitrary aggregations of identifiers. By defining an identifier superclass
which defines common functionality for interacting with the data repository, we
can then subclass this to provide functionality specific to a given category of
data. The SoSOL implementation for IDP2, for example, provides identifier
subclasses for DDbDP transcriptions, HGV metadata, and HGV translations.
Editorial boards consequently have editorial control for only certain
subclasses of identifiers. Publications in turn allow representation and
aggregation of the complex many-to-many relationships these components can have
(for example, a document with two sides that may have one transcription and two
metadata components). Packaging these related elements together both allows the
user to switch between them and editorial boards to check related data which
they may not have editorial control over but still require to make informed
decisions about validity and approval. SoSOL can thus be integrated into other
systems by implementing the identifier subclasses necessary for the given
dataset as well as coherent means for aggregating these components into
publications.

= JRuby Deployment

== WAR-based deployment

* use warbler to bundle as a standard .war (includes JRuby, gems, etc.) to upload to an app server
  * initialize/migrate your production DB using "RAILS_ENV=production jruby -S rake db:migrate" (change production line in config/database.yml for your setup)
  * may want to add "config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)" to config/environment.rb to get Rails logging out to servlet container
  * run "cap local externals:setup" to fetch externals
  * use "jruby -S warble war" to build the war
  * need to change REPOSITORY_ROOT in config/environment.rb to an absolute shared path, because packing up the 500MB+ canonical repo in the war will grind things to a halt 
* war unpacking isn't guaranteed (and multiple deploys would overwrite changes to the unpacked dir structure anyway) so it seems like alternate config will be needed
  * need a persistent directory for git (overwrite REPOSITORY_ROOT and CANONICAL_REPOSITORY in production)
  * DB migrations seem impossible to run from the deployed war context, so you'll have to run them pre-deploy using the production environment on some checkout of the code (meaning it will also need access to your production DB server credentials)
  * not sure on logs, sessions (may need extra config for new vers of Rails), rollback (probably impossible to get easily in a war context due to also needing to reverse migrations)

== Directory-based deployment

* deploy an unpacked directory and run within JRuby using any variety of servers (e.g. jetty-rails, glassfish - N.B. glassfish gem must have all required jars invoked inside JRuby on the classpath e.g. lib/java/saxon9he.jar) which can be accessed directly or proxied

= Repository Setup

== Canonical Repository (from Git)

* Initialize with:
  * git clone --bare git://github.com/papyri/idp.data.git CANONICAL_REPOSITORY
  * where CANONICAL_REPOSITORY is the path defined in config/environment.rb, defaulting to REPOSITORY_ROOT/canonical.git. For WAR-based deploy will want to change REPOSITORY_ROOT to an absolute path as noted.
 * Data now also mirrored [https://github.com/papyri/idp.data on GitHub]

= Administration

* "jruby script/console production" should give you a console for the production environment (keep in mind things like DB/Git access, you'll need to run this from a location that can access those resources, the source, and the correct configs for your production environment)
  * from here you can give users admin privileges by e.g.:
    * me = User.find_by_name('rfbaumann')
    * me.admin = true
    * me.save!
* can completely reset the database with "jruby -S rake RAILS_ENV=production db:reset"
  * note that this ''won't'' run AR callbacks, so you need to clear user/board git repos:
    * if you plan on '''keeping''' canonical (aka repo 3) i.e. not deleting it and recloning from the Git SVN copy, you need to first ensure that it has all finalized objects and remove the user repos you'll delete from its alternates file:
      * cd REPOSITORY_ROOT/canonical.git && git repack && echo "" > objects/info/alternates
      * can check integrity afterwards with "git fsck"
    * rm -rf REPOSITORY_ROOT/boards/*.git REPOSITORY_ROOT/users/*.git
  * can also delete every model instance from the console with e.g. User.find(:all).each{|u| u.destroy} but this can be tedious if there are loose instances of other models that aren't dependent-destroyed

= XSugar Standalone
* to start a local XSugar standalone server:
  * in vendor/plugins/rxsugar/src/standalone run mvn:install and mvn:jetty run
  
= Tomcat setup
* jruby -S rake RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate
* jruby -S rake RAILS_ENV=production db:structure:dump
* CREATE DATABASE sosol
* GRANT all on database sosol to 'sosoladmin'@'localhost' identified by 's0s0ladm1n'
* GRANT all on database sosol to 'sosoladmin'@'%' identified by 's0s0ladm1n'
* cat production_structure.sql | mysql -u sosoladmin -p sosol
